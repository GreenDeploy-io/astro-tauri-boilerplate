# Web app to run as a Website & as a Desktop App

Web app is based on [Astro](https://astro.build) (Astro for us is a framework on top of React).

- in browser, this web app runs as a website as-is
- in desktop, the web app has an extra wrapper around it to run as a desktop app
  - the wrapper we use is [Tauri](https://tauri.app)
